test_multiple_columns
    [X] F- create_test_dataframe handles multiple columns... or we delete it?
	[X] F-Our schema that we explicitly set with set....schema doesn't include the inferred schema from base_data
	  [X]  R-Separate the data from the construction of the thing
	        [X] R-remove optional/if around explicit schema
	        [X] R-We didn't separate the "separate the data from constructor" thing so we didn't merge the base data with data
	        [X]     R-Move one section at a time
    F-Set column method should be able to handle the issue if we have a column with the same name already
        [X] F- If the name already exists in base data or data, we cast the type
                t -  test for setting column type in data
        F- If the column already exists in the explicit schema, replace the column and type with the new explicit type
            t-test for what happens with multiple columns with the same name
    F-Explicitly set types in schema
        - B  Numbers wrapped in quotes are translated into strings INCLUDING the quotes (eg. '1')
F-Need to handle nested columns

FIX FAILING TESTS!!!

Assumption: The primary key of the columns in the schema is the column name.
