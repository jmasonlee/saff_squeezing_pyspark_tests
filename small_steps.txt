test_multiple_columns
	F-Our schema that we explicitly set with set....schema doesn't include the inferred schema from base_data
	    R-Separate the data from the construction of the thing
	        [X] R-remove optional/if around explicit schema
	            R-We didn't separate the "separate the data from constructor" thing so we didn't merge the base data with data
	                R-Move one section at a time
    F-Set column method should be able to handle the issue if we have a column with the same name already
    F-Explicitly set types in schema
    F-Specific data should override base_data
